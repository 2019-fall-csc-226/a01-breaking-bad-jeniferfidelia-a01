# (Required) Task 1
# TODO Ask user for their birth year
birth_year= int(input("please input your birth year:"))

# TODO Check the year using if conditionals, and print the correct animal for that year.
# See the a01_pets.py for examples
if birth_year == 1996
    print ("you are a rat")
elif birth_year == 1997

    print("you are a rabbit")
elif birth_year == 2000
    print ("you are a dragon")
elif birth_year == 2001
    print ("you are a snake")
elif birth_year == 2002
    print ("you are a horse")
elif birth_year == 2003

# (Required) Task 2
# TODO Ask the user for their friend's birth year


# TODO Similar to above, check your friend's year using if conditionals, and print the correct animal for that year


######################################################################
# (Optional) Task 3
# TODO Check for compatibility between your birth year and your friend's birth year
# NOTE: You can always assume the first input is your birth year (i.e., 1982 for me).
# This way, you are not writing a ton of code to consider every possibility.
# In other words, only do one row of the sample compatibility table.


# TODO print if you are a strong match, no match, or in between
